Program Purpose
The program's goal is to give administrators the ability to build courses with their own descriptions, which include the course name, code, and price. Additionally, the platform will enable administrative personnel to establish student profiles that contain the student's name, ID, and email address. 

Students can also use the program to track their balance owed to the institution and enroll in classes. Payments made by the student after enrollment must equal at least 40% of the remaining debt; else, an error message will appear.

In addition, the administrator can check individual student balances, course information, and enrolled students. 

Additionally, the application performs validation to ensure that a student ID or courae code cannot be copied. Additionally, the system will indicate that the code does not exist when trying to assign if a course code or student ID was not created. 

How does the program work?
The user must choose the number that corresponds to the desired option from the menu that appears and hit Enter to execute the code. To push a response, press enter after each entry. 

Assumptions
The ability to add a student, add a course, see course details, and examine student balances is presumed to be limited to administrators. 

Limitions
The application does not keep track of user activity and lacks restrictions over which user gets access to which menu selections. A student can be enrolled more than once for a course, the program does not recognize a duplication. Additonally, neither a student or a course can be deleted.
